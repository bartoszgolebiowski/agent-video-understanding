## 3. Cross-Frame Delta Analysis (Motion)

*   **Displacement:**
    *   The pen moved from being held in the right hand (Frame 1) to the left hand (Frame 2), and then back to the right hand (Frame 3) to write.
    *   The left hand moved from resting near the coins (Frame 1) to holding the pen (Frame 2), and then returned to resting near the coins (Frame 3).
    *   The right hand moved from writing in the notebook (Frame 1) to holding the pen in the air (Frame 2), and then returned to writing in the notebook (Frame 3).
*   **State Changes:**
    *   The primary state change is the movement of the pen and hands, indicating an action of writing.
    *   No changes in lighting, focus, or object status are observed.
*   **Hidden Data:**
    *   No data was occluded and subsequently revealed between frames. The scene remains consistent in terms of visible objects.

## 4. Semantic Context

*   **The "Why":** Based strictly on the visual evidence, the specific objective of this sequence is the recording of financial information. This is indicated by the presence of banknotes and coins alongside a notebook and pen, with the person actively writing. The action suggests budgeting, accounting, or tracking expenses/income.
*   **Technical Specs:**
    *   **Focal Length:** Wide-angle to standard focal length. The scene is not significantly compressed, and there is a moderate depth of field, allowing for some background blur.
    *   **Camera Height:** Eye-level to slightly low-angle. The perspective suggests the camera is positioned at a similar height to the table surface, looking slightly upwards at the hands.

## 5. Final Synthesis

The visual evidence depicts a person engaged in financial record-keeping. The sequence captures the act of writing in a notebook, with Euro banknotes and scattered coins present on a dark, reflective table surface. The lighting is soft and diffused, originating from the left, and the background is blurred, focusing attention on the immediate task. The movement of the pen and hands clearly indicates the process of documenting financial transactions or managing a budget.
