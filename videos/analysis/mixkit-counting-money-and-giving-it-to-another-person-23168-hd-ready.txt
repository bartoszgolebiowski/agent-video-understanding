## Cross-Frame Delta Analysis (Motion)

*   **Displacement:**
    *   The US Dollar bill moved from being not visible in Frame 1 to being held by Person 1 in Frame 2.
    *   Person 1's right arm and hand moved into the frame from the right, holding the currency.
    *   Person 2's left hand moved into the frame from the left, reaching towards the currency.
    *   The currency, held by Person 1, appears to be in the process of being transferred to Person 2.
    *   All visible subjects from Frame 2 are absent in Frame 3.
*   **State Changes:**
    *   The primary state change is the introduction and subsequent removal of subjects and the currency.
    *   Focus remains consistent across the frames where subjects are present.
    *   Lighting remains consistent.
*   **Hidden Data:**
    *   In Frame 1, the hands of both individuals and the currency were occluded.
    *   In Frame 2, the majority of both individuals (bodies, faces) are occluded.
    *   In Frame 3, the subjects and currency from Frame 2 are now occluded.

## Semantic Context

*   **The "Why":** Based strictly on the visual evidence, the specific objective of this sequence is to depict a transaction involving the transfer of US currency. Specifically, it shows one person handing a $100 bill to another.
*   **Technical Specs:**
    *   Focal Length: Appears to be a moderate focal length, possibly around 50mm, allowing for a clear view of the hands and currency without significant distortion. It is not a wide-angle or extreme telephoto.
    *   Camera Height: Eye-level, consistent with a natural perspective of observing a transaction.

## Final Synthesis

The visual sequence documents a financial exchange. Frame 1 establishes a neutral, empty background. Frame 2 introduces two hands engaged in a transaction, with one individual in a green checkered shirt clearly presenting a $100 bill to another individual whose hand is reaching out from the left. The text on the bill is legible, confirming its denomination and origin. Frame 3 returns to the empty background, indicating the completion of the transaction and the departure of the subjects. The objective is a clear, albeit brief, visual representation of money changing hands.
